        the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining
        new_pos_dist makes use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule
        above:

          1) self.set_ghost_position(game_state, ghost_position)
              This method alters the game_state by placing the ghost we're
              tracking in a particular position.  This altered game_state can be
              used to query what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.get_position_distribution(game_state)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the
              ghost will move to from the provided game_state.  The ghost must be
              placed in the game_state with a call to self.set_ghost_position
              above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper methods
        are used and how they combine to give us a belief distribution over new
        positions after a time update from a particular position.

        To loop over the ghosts, use:

          for i in range(self.num_ghosts):
            ...

        Then, assuming that `i` refers to the index of the ghost, to obtain the
        distributions over new positions for that single ghost, given the list
        (prevGhostPositions) of previous positions of ALL of the ghosts, use
        this line of code:

          new_pos_dist = get_position_distribution_for_ghost(
             set_ghost_positions(game_state, prevGhostPositions), i, self.ghost_agents[i]
          )

        Note that you may need to replace `prevGhostPositions` with the correct
        name of the variable that you have used to refer to the list of the
        previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may need to replace `i`
        with the variable you have used to refer to the index of the ghost for
        which you are computing the new position distribution.

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code above for obtaining new_pos_dist makes use of two helper
        functions defined below in this file:

          1) set_ghost_positions(game_state, ghostPositions)
              This method alters the game_state by placing the ghosts in the
              supplied positions.

          2) get_position_distribution_for_ghost(game_state, ghost_index, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what
              positions a ghost (ghost_index) controlled by a particular agent
              (ghost_agent) will move to in the supplied game_state.  All ghosts
              must first be placed in the game_state using set_ghost_positions
              above.

              The ghost agent you are meant to supply is
              self.ghost_agents[ghost_index-1], but in this project all ghost
              agents are always the same.
